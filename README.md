# Pic Scribe

## About the project

I made a image captioning model by using ViT as encoder and Transformer Decoder as decoder, and training it with COCO2017 dataset. 
Then deployed these models to iOS app by converting these models into CoreML and building an iOS app with SwiftUI.

Here are some useful links of this repo:

Plus you can download and test the model on HuggingFace too. HuggingFace
